# EDA - Explotary Data Analysis - Finding meaning out of tons of data thrown at you & leading to a meaningful conclusion ...
No just human beings & their excel cant do that job when **Volume, Velocity, Variety (VVV) of data is huge**.
EDA is key step for any Data Science or ML project. You were thrown tons of data. Now you got to figure out what is imp & whats not. You got to figure out the 
realtionship & corelation among all data. Particulalry corelation with respect to your target (y) variable is key. Things get more complex when you have tons 
of data + tons of features + multiple target variables.

There r multiple tools for EDA in python like 1. Python Profiling 2. D-Tale 3. dabl LIB OF PYTHON 4. sweetviz 5. autoviz
## EDA_using_Pandas_Profiling.py --> Display power of Pandas Profiling
Here we will build our own EDA app in Python using Pandas Profiling and Streamlit. With this web application you will be able to upload a CSV data to the app and it will **automatically** *generate an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report*. Output really looks sharp until you bump into D-TALE which is just swesome & best so far!!
